# Ginkerate
Ginkerate is a personal project I made after reading the RustBook to practice what I've just learned.

## Context :
I've been quiet annoyed of setting up the same project folders over and over, one day I've decided to just put all my boilerplates in the ***~/Templates*** directory and just ***cp ~/Template/<project_template> .***
It helped for a while, but after reading half of the RustBook, I wanted to practice Rust a little bit, so I came with the idea of making a CLI to help me setup my Projects.

## Usage :
As easy as it seems.

    ginker <Project Name> <Template Type>
And you're ready to go
## Prerequisite
A *Template folder* located in the *Home* directory containing the actual templates.

**Example :**
```bash
Templates
├── example1
│   ├── a
│   ├── b
│   ├── c
│   └── d
│       ├── a
│       ├── b
│       └── c
└── p5
    ├── index.html
    └── sketch.js

```
